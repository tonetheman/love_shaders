Here are some shaders that I found and translated to lua/love.

I am absolutely not the author of these shaders I just changed them enough to get them to work in lua. Complete and total props back to the original authors.

The site I used to find shaders is shadertoy https://www.shadertoy.com/

Amazing work is done there.

I tried to leave some comments in the files. 

Very cool that love/lua even exists. Check it out here https://love2d.org/

To use any of these shaders you need love version 0.9.1 (the newest as of 2014/07/01). Get love installed then you can clone this repo and just run love on each of the directories. The shaders are really mind blowing to me. Cool stuff.

Here is a screenshot of what the flame shader looks like:

And then one from the shader fire too ![shader fire](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonetheman/love_shaders/master/shader_fire_example.png)
