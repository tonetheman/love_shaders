Here are some shaders that I found and translated to lua/love.

I am absolutely not the author of these shaders I just changed them enough to get them to work in lua. Complete and total props back to the original authors.

The site I used to find shaders is shadertoy https://www.shadertoy.com/

Amazing work is done there.

I tried to leave some comments in the files. Very cool that love/lua even exists.
